# PhotoEditor

## Project Overview
Developed a Photo Editor with Java as a final project for my Software Design course. At the time of my submission, my project was fully functional, but as time progressed the dependencies needed to run the project became superannuated and no longer functioned. As such, as its no longer possible to run the project without
major alterations to the code, I have decided to also share a PowerPoint containing a demo and further details of the application.

## Illustrations
Review the Android Studio Photo Editor Experience- Josue Flores.pptx file.

## Scope of Functionality
As aforementioned within the Project Overview, this project is a photo editor that allows the user to edit any image file within their gallery or any photo they take within the application. Once you open the application, you are prompted into your gallery to select an image to edit. Once selected, you are provided an interface that allows you to apply filters, effects,
edits(cropping/rotating) the image, take a new photo with the built-in camera (the camera icon), select a different image (plus Note icon), and/or save the newly edited image (download icon).

Upon clicking the Edits card, you are given the opportunity to crop the image to various aspect ratio such as (3:4, 2:3, 16:9, 9:16), rotate the photo up to 360 degrees clockwise and counter-clockwise, and scale the size of the image based on a sliding percentage.

Upon clicking the Effects card, you can alter the brightness and saturation of the photo with the built-in value sliders.

Upon clicking the Filters card, you can select from an assortment of filters to apply to your image such as Clarendon, Mars, Amazon, Starlit, and much more.
